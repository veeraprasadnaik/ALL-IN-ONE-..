 ALL IN ONE PROJECT

This is an IoT-based smart monitoring system using ESP8266 (NodeMCU).
The project combines multiple sensors like Ultrasonic Sensor and DHT11 Sensor in a single system.

Features:

Distance measurement using Ultrasonic Sensor

Temperature and Humidity monitoring using DHT11

Real-time data monitoring in Blynk IoT app

WiFi-based wireless communication

This project is useful for Diploma ECE students to understand IoT, Embedded Systems, and sensor interfacing.
