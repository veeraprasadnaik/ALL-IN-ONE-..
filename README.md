🔴🟡🟢 Day 1 | Traffic Light Controller – RTL Design

Kicked off my 15-Days RTL Design journey with a Traffic Light Controller project.

✔ Designed and synthesized the RTL
✔ Analyzed Device View (Floorplan)
✔ Generated RTL, Elaborated, and Technology Schematics
✔ Verified functionality using simulation waveforms
✔ Checked FPGA resource utilization

This project strengthened my understanding of FSM-based design, Verilog RTL flow, and FPGA implementation.
A strong foundation project for VLSI and Digital Electronics beginners.

🔴🟡🟢 Day 1 | RTL Design Series

Started my 15-day RTL challenge with a real-time Traffic Light Controller.

Completed the full design flow:

RTL coding & schematics

Post-synthesis technology view

Simulation and verification

Floorplanning and resource analysis

A great hands-on project to learn FSM, Verilog, synthesis, and FPGA basics in VLSI.

🔴🟡🟢 Day 1 | From RTL to FPGA

Beginning my 15-Days RTL Design series with a Traffic Light Controller implementation.

Worked through:

RTL & elaborated schematics

Post-synthesis technology schematic

Simulation waveform validation

FPGA device view and utilization

This project clearly demonstrates the complete RTL-to-FPGA flow, making it an ideal starter project in VLSI and Digital Electronics.

🗳️ Day 2 | Digital Voting Machine – RTL Flow

As part of my 15-day RTL challenge, I designed a Digital Voting Machine using Verilog.

✔ RTL coding and verification
✔ Pre-synthesis and post-synthesis schematics
✔ Simulation waveform analysis
✔ FPGA floorplanning and resource utilization

A great project to learn control logic, state transitions, and complete RTL-to-FPGA flow in VLSI.

🗳️ Day 2 | RTL Design Series

Day 2 of my RTL Design series focused on implementing a Digital Voting Machine.

Covered:

RTL, elaborated, and technology schematics

Simulation-based functional verification

Synthesized device view and FPGA resource analysis

This project strengthened my skills in Verilog, FSM design, synthesis, and FPGA-based digital systems.
